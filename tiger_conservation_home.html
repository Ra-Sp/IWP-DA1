      <h2>About Tigers</h2>
      <p>
        Tigers are majestic creatures, known for their striking appearance, strength, and stealth.
        As the largest members of the cat family, they command respect in their natural habitats across Asia.
        With their distinctive orange coats adorned with black stripes, they blend seamlessly into the dense
        forests and grasslands where they reside.
      </p>

      <p>
        Indian Tigers, also known as Bengal Tigers, are perhaps the most iconic subspecies.
        They are found primarily in India, although their range extends into neighboring countries like Nepal,
        Bhutan, and Bangladesh. Renowned for their grace and power, these tigers once roamed throughout the Indian
        subcontinent in large numbers. However, due to habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict, their
        population has dwindled significantly in recent decades.
      </p>

      <p>
        Despite conservation efforts, Indian Tigers remain endangered, with only around 2,500 individuals estimated to
        be
        left in the wild. National parks and reserves like Ranthambore, Bandhavgarh, and Corbett serve as crucial
        sanctuaries for these magnificent creatures, providing protected spaces where they can roam freely and breed.
        Conservationists and government agencies work tirelessly to preserve these habitats and combat the threats
        facing
        Indian Tigers, aiming to ensure their survival for future generations to admire and cherish.
      </p>

      <h2>Tiger Statistics - India</h2>
      <div id="tigerStats">
        <p><span style="font-size: xx-large; font-weight: 400;">Tigers</span> are a conservation dependent species.
          Major threats to tigers are poaching that is driven by an illegal international demand for tiger parts and
          products, depletion of tiger prey, and habitat loss due to the ever increasing demand for forested lands. To
          gauge the success of conservation efforts as well as to have a finger on the pulse of tiger populations and
          their ecosystems, the National Tiger Conservation Authority in collaboration with the State Forest
          Departments, the Wildlife Institute of India and conservation partners conducts a National assessment for the
          “Status of Tigers, Co-predators, Prey and their Habitat” once inevery four years. The methodology used for
          this assessment was approved by the Tiger Task Force in 2005. The first assessment based on this scientific
          methodology was done in 2006 and subsequently in 2010, 2014 and 2018.</p>
        <p>In 2006, the tiger population was estimated at 1,411 (1,165 to 1,657) which was much lower than the earlier
          official estimates. This brought about major changes in tiger conservation policy, legislation, and
          management. Special stress was laid on village relocation from core/critical tiger habitats and enhancing
          protection by creating the Special Tiger Protection Force. Subsequently, these concerted actions resulted in
          an upward trend in the tiger population as documented by the 2010 population estimates of 1,706.</p>
        <p>However, the 2010 assessment also showed a decline in tiger occupied area. This decline in tiger occupancy
          was recorded in areas outside of tiger reserves, indicating loss of habitat quality and extent – a crucial
          element essential for maintaining genetic connectivity between individual tiger populations. To address this
          vital conservation concern, the NTCA in collaboration with the WII delineated the minimal tiger habitat
          corridors connecting tiger reserves for implementing landscape scale tiger conservation. Now all tiger
          reserves manage their tiger populations based on a tiger conservation plan (TCP), which addresses specific
          prescriptions for core, buffer, and corridor habitats.</p>
        <p>The 2014 assessment, further bore testimony to the inputs provided by Project Tiger and based on the double
          sampling approach, showed a 30% increase over the previous cycle. India now has 70 % of the global tiger
          population at 2226. 1540 distinct camera trapped photographs of tigers have been obtained and the rest based
          on sound statistically robust, spatially explicit capture recapture (SECR) models.</p>
        <p>The fourth cycle of National tiger status assessment of 2018-19 is the most accurate survey conducted. The
          survey covered 381,400 km 2 of forested habitats in 20 tiger occupied states of India. A foot survey of
          522,996 km was done for carnivore signs and prey abundance estimation. In these forests, 317,958 habitat plots
          were sampled for vegetation, human impacts and prey dung.</p>
        <p>Camera traps were deployed at 26,838 locations. These cameras resulted in 34,858,623 photographs of wildlife
          of which 76,651 were of tigers and 51,777 were of leopards. The total area sampled by camera traps was 121,337
          km 2 . The total effort invested in the survey was 593,882 man-days. We believe that this is the world’s
          largest effort invested in any wildlife survey till date, on all of the above criteria.</p>
        <p>A total of 2,461 individual tigers (>1 year of age) were photo-captured. The overall tiger population in
          India was estimated at 2,967 (SE range 2,603 to 3,346). Out of this, 83% were actually camera trapped
          individual tigers and 87% were accounted for by camera-trap based capture-mark-recapture and remaining 13%
          estimated through covariate based models. Tigers were observed to be increasing at a rate of 6% per annum in
          India when consistently sampled areas were compared from 2006 to 2018. Tiger occupancy was found to be stable
          at 88,985 km 2 the country scale since 2014 (88,558 km 2 ). Though there were losses and gains at individual
          landscapes and state scales.</p>
